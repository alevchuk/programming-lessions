# Prerequisites

## GitHub
(1 minute to open your laptop and go to github)
https://github.com/alevchuk/programming-lessions

## GitHub Account
(5 minutes to create a github account)

Create an accound so you can make changes to the documentation.

## Hardware
This tutorial assumes you're using a Mac computer (laptop or desktop)

## Book
(1 minute to open the book)

We'll be following the book "Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"

[Electronic copy: https://github.com/CWade3051/Py/...]( https://github.com/CWade3051/Py/blob/master/Absolute%20Book/Python%20Programming%20for%20the%20Absolute%20Beginner%2C%203rd%20Edition/Python%20Programming%20for%20the%20Absolute%20Beginner%2C%203rd%20Edition.pdf)


## Skills

### Running shell commands
(3 minutes to learn how to use the Terminal app)

You need to know how to run shell commands:
1. In manuals and online sometimes you'll see Shell commands that you want to run for actions, such as installing a new version of python. Let take a toy example of a Shell command. It looks like this: `echo Hello World`
1. Copy the command from the manual. Use copy-and-paste (not typing) for accuracy.
2. Open the Terminal (fastest way to find the Terminal on Mac is to type "ter" in the Spotlight Search - which is the magnifying glass in the top right)
3. Paste the command and hit Enter
4. Once Terminal is open, right-click on its icon in your Mac's Dock and select Options -> Keep in Dock (that way you don't have to look for the Terminal every time you need it)


## Software Tools
(20 minutes to install Atom, Xcode, Brew, and Python 3)

Install the text editor:
1. Got to https://atom.io/
2. Click Download for Mac
3. Go through the installation
4. Once Atom is open, right-click on its icon in your Mac's Dock and select Options -> Keep in Dock (that way you don't have to look for the Text Editor every time you need it)

While text editor installs, install Python 3 (also Xcode and Brew)

First, make /usr/local/bin you default location for launching system utilities such as Python
```
echo -e '\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Now follow "Installing Python 3" manual 
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/

(follow the "Doing it Right" section of the webpage "Installing Python 3 on Mac OS X: The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python")
The page will show you how to install Apple Xcode which is a perquisite for installing Python 3 via the Brew package manager.

Make the command "python" always open "python3.5" (the default on Mac is python2.6)
Open Terminal and run:
```
echo -e '\nalias python="/usr/local/bin/python3.6"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

## Editor Setup
(10 minutes to get familiar and Setup)

Install Atom's "script-runner" package so we can run Python directly from the text editor

1. Follow [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyVnWjZzGVY
), yet instead of [**script** by rgbkrk](https://atom.io/packages/script) look for [**script-runner** by ioquatix](https://atom.io/packages/script-runner)
2. In the same way as above, install [MagicPython by MagicStack](https://atom.io/packages/MagicPython) - it's a programing language syntax highlighter - uses color to show various parts of the code
