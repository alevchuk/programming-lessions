# Prerequisites

## Prerequisites: Hardware
(1 minute open your laptop and login to github)

This tutorial assumes your using a Mac computer (laptop or desktop)

Open your browser and go to https://github.com/alevchuk/programming-lessions


## Prerequisites: Book
(1 minute to open the book)

We'll be following the book "Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition"

Electronic copy https://github.com/CWade3051/Py/blob/master/Absolute%20Book/Python%20Programming%20for%20the%20Absolute%20Beginner%2C%203rd%20Edition/Python%20Programming%20for%20the%20Absolute%20Beginner%2C%203rd%20Edition.pdf


## Prerequisites: Skills
(3 minutes to lear how to use the Terminal app)

You need to know how to run shell commands:
1. Copy the command from the manual. Use copy-and-paste (not typing) for accuracy.
2. Open the Terminal (fastest way to find the Terminal on Mac is to type "ter" in the Spotlight Search - which is the magnifying glass in the top right)
3. Paste the command and hit Enter
4. Once Terminal is open, right-click on it's icon in your Mac's Dock and select Options -> Keep in Doc (that way you don't have to look for the Terminal every time you need it)


## Prerequisites: Software Tools
(20 minutes to install Atom, Xcode, Brew, and Python 3)

Install the text editor:
1. Got to https://atom.io/
2. Click Download for Mac
3. Go through the installation
4. Once Atom is open, right-click on it's icon in your Mac's Dock and select Options -> Keep in Doc (that way you don't have to look for the Text Editor every time you need it)

While text editor installs, install Python 3 (also Xcode and Brew)
https://www.google.com/search?q=install+python+3+mac
(follow the "Doing it Right" section of the webpage "Installing Python 3 on Mac OS X: The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python")
The page will show you how to install Apple Xcode which is a perquisite for installing Python 3 via the Brew package manager.

Make the command "python" always open "python3.5" (the default on Mac is ptyhon2.6)
Open Terminal and run:
```
echo -e '\nalias python="/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.5"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

## Prerequisites: Editor Setup
(10 minutes to get familiar and Setup)

Install Atom's "Script" package so we can run Python directly from the text editor

In the same way as above, install "MagicPython" (a syntax highlighter by MagicStack)
